# Synthetic-Watermelon
Co-designed this game with Haylie Wu on Northwestern CS211. C++ is the main language that we have used. 


# Intruction to play
Watermelon of random sizes appear on top of the screen. Move the mouse to change the drop location, and click to drop the watermelon. Watermelon freezes once it touches the bottom or touches other watermelon. Identical watermelon will merge to a bigger one when they touch. Let's how big you can synthesize your watermelon into (p.s.: our biggest watermelon is Morty)

# How to run
Just download our code on github, run the code on your code editor and have fun!
